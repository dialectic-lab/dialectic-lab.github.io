Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) provides historic data of rainfall in India. Since some of this predates the formation of modern Indian states, the geographic regions listed here are slightly different.

This is a plot of annual rainfall data between the years 1901 and 2017. The darker bands indicate wetter regions. Values are in mm.
